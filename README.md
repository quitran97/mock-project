### INSTRUCTIONS

1. Use React Apis (preferably hooks) to connect the Todo Form with the Todo List. User must be able to:

   - [] Add new Todo by fill in the Todo Form and hit the Submit button
   - [] Delete Todo by hitting the X icon
   - [] Toggle a Todo completed/active by hitting the empty/checked radio button icon
     - [] "Todo 1" represents an active todo
     - [] "Todo 2" represents a completed todo
   - [] Filter the Todo List by "All", "Active", and "Completed" statuses. I.e
     - [] When "All" is selected, both "Todo 1" and "Todo 2" will shown
     - [] When "Active" is selected, only "Todo 1" will be shown
     - [] When "Completed" is selected, only "Todo 2" will be shown
     - [] Make sure to reflect the correct buttons' variations

2. Take a look at Image.png, style the Todo Form and Todo List accordingly
